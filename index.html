				<div class="text8">"You look just fine, my lord," Pym said in a bracing tone from the front compartment. Miles's face heated, and he flinched away from his reflection. He recovered himself enough to take the flower arrangement and rolled-up flimsy Pym handed out to him with, he hoped, a tolerably bland expression. He balanced the load in his arms, turned to face the front steps, and took a deep breath.</div>
				<div class="text9">After about a minute, Pym inquired helpfully from behind him, "Would you like me to carry anything?"</div>
				<div class="text10">"No. Thank you." Miles trod up the steps and wiggled a finger free to press the chime-pad. Pym pulled out a reader, and settled comfortably in the groundcar to await his lord's pleasure.</div>
				<div class="text11">Footsteps sounded from within, and the door swung open on the smiling pink face of the Professora. Her gray hair was wound up on her head in her usual style. She wore a dark rose dress with a light rose bolero, embroidered with green vines in the manner of her home District. This somewhat formal Vor mode, which suggested she was just on her way either in or out, was belied by the soft buskins on her feet. "Hello, Miles. Goodness, you're prompt."</div>
				<div class="text12">"Professora." Miles ducked a nod to her, and smiled in turn. "Is she here? Is she in? Is she well? You said this would be a good time. I'm not too early, am I? I thought I'd be late. The traffic was miserable. You're going to be around, aren't you? I brought these. Do you think she'll like them?" The sticking-up red flowers tickled his nose as he displayed his gift while still clutching the rolled-up flimsy, which had a tendency to try to unroll and escape whenever his grip loosened.</div>
				<div class="text13">"Come in, yes, all's well. She's here, she's fine, and the flowers are very nice - " The Professora rescued the bouquet and ushered him into her tiled hallway, closing the door firmly behind them with her foot. The house was dim and cool after the spring sunshine outside, and had a fine aroma of wood wax, old books, and a touch of academic dust.</div>
				<div class="text14">"She looked pretty pale and fatigued at Tien's funeral. Surrounded by all those relatives. We really didn't get a chance to say more than two words each." I'm sorry and Thank you, to be precise. Not that he'd wanted to talk much to the late Tien Vorsoisson's family.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>
				<div class="text15">"It was an immense strain for her, I think," said the Professora judiciously. "She'd been through so much horror, and except for Georg and myself - and you - there wasn't a soul there to whom she could talk truth about it. Of course, her first concern was getting Nikki through it all. But she held together without a crack from first to last. I was very proud of her."</div>
				<div class="text16">"Indeed. And she is... ?" Miles craned his neck, glancing into the rooms off the entry hall: a cluttered study lined with bookshelves, and a cluttered parlor lined with bookshelves. No young widows.</div>
				<div class="text17">"Right this way." The Professora conducted him down the hall and out through her kitchen to the little urban back garden. A couple of tall trees and a brick wall made a private nook of it. Beyond a tiny circle of green grass, at a table in the shade, a woman sat with flimsies and a reader spread before her. She was chewing gently on the end of a stylus, and her dark brows were drawn down in her absorption. She wore a calf-length dress in much the same style as the Professora's, but solid black, with the high collar buttoned up to her neck. Her bolero was gray, trimmed with simple black braid running around its edge. Her dark hair was drawn back to a thick braided knot at the nape of her neck. She looked up at the sound of the door opening; her brows flew up and her lips parted in a flashing smile that made Miles blink. Ekaterin.</div>
				<div class="text18">"Mil - my Lord Auditor!" She rose in a flare of skirt; he bowed over her hand."Mil - my Lord Auditor!" She rose in a flare of skirt; he bowed over her hand."Mil - my Lord Auditor!" She rose in a flare of skirt; he bowed over her hand."Mil - my Lord Auditor!" She rose in a flare of skirt; he bowed over her hand."Mil - my Lord Auditor!" She rose in a flare of skirt; he bowed over her hand."Mil - my Lord Auditor!" She rose in a flare of skirt; he bowed over her hand.</div>
				<div class="text19">"Madame Vorsoisson. You look well." She looked wonderful, if still much too pale. Part of that might be the effect of all that severe black, which also made her eyes show a brilliant blue-gray. "Welcome to Vorbarr Sultana. I brought these..." He gestured, and the Professora set the flower arrangement down on the table. "Though they hardly seem needed, out here."</div>
				<div class="text20">"They're lovely," Ekaterin assured him, sniffing them in approval. "I'll take them up to my room later, where they will be very welcome. Since the weather has brightened up, I find I spend as much time as possible out here, under the real sky." "They're lovely," Ekaterin assured him, sniffing them in approval. "I'll take them up to my room later, where they will be very welcome. Since the weather has brightened up, I find I spend as much time as possible out here, under the real sky."

				<div class="text21">She'd spent nearly a year sealed in a Komarran dome. "I can understand that," Miles said. The conversation hiccuped to a brief stop, while they smiled at each other.She'd spent nearly a year sealed in a Komarran dome. "I can understand that," Miles said.

				<div class="text22">Ekaterin recovered first. "Thank you for coming to Tien's funeral. It meant so much to me."
					"It was the least I could do, under the circumstances. I'm only sorry I couldn't do more."
					"But you've already done so much for me and Nikki - " She broke off at his gesture of embarrassed denial and instead said,
					"But won't you sit down? Aunt Vorthys - ?" She drew back one of the spindly garden chairs.
					The Professora shook her head. "I have a few things to attend to inside. Carry on." She added a little cryptically, "You'll do fine."
					She went back into her house, and Miles sat across from Ekaterin, placing his flimsy on the table to await its strategic moment.
					It half-unrolled, eagerly."Is your case all wound up?" she asked.
					"That case will have ramifications for years to come, but I'm done with it for now," Miles replied. "I just turned in my last reports yesterday, or I would have been here to welcome you earlier." Well, that and a vestigial sense that he'd ought to let the poor woman at least get her bags unpacked, before descending in force.
					"Will you be sent out on another assignment now?"

				</div>
				<div class="text23">"I don't think Gregor will let me risk getting tied up elsewhere till after his marriage. For the next couple of months, I'm afraid all my duties will be social ones."
					"I'm sure you'll do them with your usual flair."
					God, I hope not. "I don't think flair is exactly what my Aunt Vorpatril - she's in charge of all the Emperor's wedding arrangements - would wish from me. More like, shut up and do what you're told, Miles. But speaking of paperwork, how's your own? Is Tien's estate settled? Did you manage to recapture Nikki's guardianship from that cousin of his?"
					"Vassily Vorsoisson? Yes, thank heavens, there was no problem with that part."
					"So, ah, what's all this, then?" Miles nodded at the cluttered table.
					"I'm planning my course work for the next session at university. I was too late to start this summer, so I'll begin in the fall.
					There's so much to choose from. I feel so ignorant."
					"Educated is what you aim to be coming out, not going in."
					"I suppose so."
					"And what will you choose?"
					"Oh, I'll start with basics - biology, chemistry..." She brightened. "One real horticulture course." She gestured at her flimsies.
					"For the rest of the season, I'm trying to find some sort of paying work. I'd like to feel I'm not totally dependent on the charity of my relatives, even if it's only my pocket money."
				</div>
				<div class="text24">That seemed almost the opening he was looking for, but Miles's eye caught sight of a red ceramic basin, sitting on the wooden planks forming a seat bordering a raised garden bed. In the middle of the pot a red-brown blob, with a fuzzy fringe like a rooster's
					crest growing out of it, pushed up through the dirt. If it was what he thought...
					He pointed to the basin. "Is that by chance your old bonsai'd skellytum? Is it going to live?"
					She smiled. "Well, at least it's the start of a new skellytum. Most of the fragments of the old one died on the way home from Komarr, but that one took."
					"You have a - for native Barrayaran plants, I don't suppose you can call it a green thumb, can you?"
					"Not unless they're suffering from some pretty serious plant diseases, no."
					"Speaking of gardens." Now, how to do this without jamming his foot in his mouth too deeply. "I don't think, in all the other uproar, I ever had a chance to tell you how impressed I was with your garden designs that I saw on your comconsole."
				</div>
				<div class="text25">"Oh." Her smile fled, and she shrugged. "They were no great thing. Just twiddling."
					Right. Let them not bring up any more of the recent past than absolutely necessary, till time had a chance to blunt memory's razor edges. "It was your Barrayaran garden, the one with all the native species, which caught my eye. I'd never seen anything like it."
					"There are a dozen of them around. Several of the District universities keep them, as living libraries for their biology students.
					It's not really an original idea."
				</div>
				<div class="text26">"Well," he persevered, feeling like a fish swimming upstream against this current of self-deprecation, " I thought it was very fine, and deserved better than just being a ghost garden on the holovid. I have this spare lot, you see..."
					He flattened out his flimsy, which was a ground plot of the block occupied by Vorkosigan House. He tapped his finger on the bare square at the end. "There used to be another great house, next to ours, which was torn down during the Regency. ImpSec wouldn't let us build anything else - they wanted it as a security zone. There's nothing there but some scraggly grass, and a couple of trees that somehow survived ImpSec's enthusiasm for clear lines of fire. And a criss-cross of walks, where people made mud paths by taking short cuts, and they finally gave up and put some gravel down. It's an extremely boring piece of ground." So boring he had completely ignored it, till now.
					She tilted her head, to follow his hand as it blocked out the space on the ground plan. Her own long finger made to trace a delicate curve, but then shyly withdrew. He wondered what possibility her mind's eye had just seen, there.
					"Now, I think," he went on valiantly, "that it would be a splendid thing to install a Barrayaran garden - all native species -
				</div>
				<div class="text27">open to the public, in this space. A sort of gift from the Vorkosigan family to the city of Vorbarr Sultana. With running water, like in your design, and walks and benches and all those civilized things. And those discreet little name tags on all the plants, so more people could learn about the old ecology and all that." There: art, public service, education - was there any bait he'd left off his hook? Oh yes, money. "It's a happy chance that you're looking for a summer job," chance, hah, watch and see if I leave anything to chance, "because I think you'd be the ideal person to take this on. Design and oversee the installation of the thing. I could give you an unlimited, um, generous budget, and a salary, of course. You could hire workmen, bring in whatever you needed.
					And she would have to visit Vorkosigan House practically every day, and consult frequently with its resident lord. And by the time the shock of her husband's death had worn away, and she was ready to put off her forbidding formal mourning garb, and every unattached Vor bachelor in the capital showed up on her doorstep, Miles could have a lock on her affections that would permit him to fend off the most glittering competition. It was too soon, wildly too soon, to suggest courtship to her crippled heart; he had that clear in his head, even if his own heart howled in frustration. But a straightforward business friendship just might get past her guard....
					Her eyebrows had flown up; she touched an uncertain finger to those exquisite, pale unpainted lips. "This is exactly the sort of thing I wish to train to do. I don't know how to do it yet."
					"On-the-job training," Miles responded instantly. "Apprenticeship. Learning by doing. You have to start sometime. You can't start sooner than now."
					"But what if I make some dreadful mistake?"
					"I do intend this be an ongoing project. People who are enthusiasts about this sort of thing always seem to be changing their gardens around. They get bored with the same view all the time, I guess. If you come up with better ideas later, you can always revise the plan. It will provide variety."
					"I don't want to waste your money."
					If she ever became Lady Vorkosigan, she would have to get over that quirk, Miles decided firmly.
					"You don't have to decide here on the spot," he purred, and cleared his throat. Watch that tone, boy. Business. "Why don't you come to Vorkosigan House tomorrow, and walk over the site in person, and see what ideas it stirs up in your mind. You really can't tell anything by looking at a flimsy. We can have lunch, afterward, and talk about what you see as the problems and possibilities then. Logical?"
				</div>
				<div class="text28">"Well," he persevered, feeling like a fish swimming upstream against this current of self-deprecation, " I thought it was very fine, and deserved better than just being a ghost garden on the holovid. I have this spare lot, you see..."
					He flattened out his flimsy, which was a ground plot of the block occupied by Vorkosigan House. He tapped his finger on the bare square at the end.

					"Now, I think," he went on valiantly, "that it would be a splendid thing to install a Barrayaran garden - all native species -
					She blinked. "Yes, very." Her hand crept back curiously toward the flimsy.
